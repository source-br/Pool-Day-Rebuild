Pool Party- 

Created in 1978, Pool Party was a very famous aquatic center 
in Barmenias from 1995 to 2002. Since then, it has been going 
through a financial crisis that will be hard to overcome. 
The location has become one of the main targets of the Terrorists, 
for reasons we still do not understand.

Counter-Terrorists: Already prepared, the Counter-Terrorist squad 
was deployed to rescue the CLIENT, which they successfully accomplished.
Their final objective now is to eliminate the hired terrorists.

Terrorists: Tasked with eliminating an important figure for the 
city of Barmenias, they failed in their mission and allowed the 
target to escape.

Other Notes: There are 2 targets 
in this mission.
